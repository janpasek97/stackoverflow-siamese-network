\paragraph{}
We created a web application that allows us to browse and search in the Stackoverflow data using the Elasticsearch full-text queries. Furthermore, the application is ready for the integration of information retrieval techniques using the obtained vector representations of questions. In other words, the application will serve to demonstrate the benefits of this work, which is beyond the scope of this work.

\paragraph{}
In this appending, you can find screenshots (figures \ref{web_app_home} - \ref{question_2}) obtained from the application. Each screenshot is accompanied by a short caption with a description of the functionality. The purpose of the screenshots is to get an impression of how does the application work. A reader is not expected to read the text in the figures.
