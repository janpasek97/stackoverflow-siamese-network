This github repository contains all resources used in my Bachelor Thesis. The repository contains all scripts to create a dataset made up of Stackoverflow duplicate questions, Tensorflow models and train/evaluation scripts.

### Abstract
This bachelor thesis aims to create a neural network for natural language
understanding in expert domains. Our outcome can significantly improve
tasks such as information retrieval or code generation. The work proposes a
neural network architecture utilizing a code encoder in parallel with a commonly
used text encoder. Furthermore, the architecture uses a not widely
known f1 loss, significantly improving results. An important outcome of
this work is a vector representation of text stored in hidden layers of the
network. We demonstrate our approach on Stackoverflow data utilizing duplicate
questions to create a novel dataset, usable beyond the scope of this
work. Our architecture achieved f1 score of 74.1% , which is a 5.1% improvement
compared to a baseline model based on word embedding summation.
